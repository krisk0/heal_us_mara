# Heal us, Mara

Modification for Crusader Kings 3.

Allows landed owner to pray to goddess Mara for healing. During a special ceremony, that costs 1000 piety, Mara attempts to heal all diseases on all who is present. With a non-zero probability, every curable disease might be healed immediately.

## Technical requirements

* Crusader Kings version Crown 1.15.0.2.

* Elder Kings modification version 0.15.1.

## Languages supported

* English.

## Motivation

There are many gods in Nirn. However their influence is minimal. For instance, Mara never helps court physicians heal wounds or diseases. They say those who worship Mara may get random events that result in healing, but these events are quite rare and should not be relied upon.

*"I created a custom faith that worships Mara among other gods, I am a mighty emperor, I am a paragon of virtue, I have tons of piety, prestige and money. Now how do I heal my daughter who caught lovers pox? — No way, rare random event only".*

## Healing ceremony

Player or NPC who

* owns land,

* whose pantheon includes Mara,

* is not at war or at special activity,

* is physically present in his residence,

* has reached piety level 3 (Devoted Servant) or above,

may organize a special ceremony that costs 1000 piety. The ceremony is attended by all courtiers who are present at court and have a curable disease. During the ceremony, every curable disease has a chance to be healed. The chance depends on Mara's attitude towards liege and sick courtier and is at least 5% (20% for children). If liege has highest piety level and many children and love relations, the chance might be 50% or more, even if courtier is a sinner in eyes of Mara.

Thus Mara's healing is more useful for old and established liege and courtier and less useful for young rules and sinners. But, if you are not buying claims or reforming religion, you have no use for your piety.

2. Can you add support for another language? — No, I am terribly busy, I am taking Imperial Island.
